I host my things on a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/). [Headlessly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_computer), of course.

Formerly used a repurposed [Acer Travelmate B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_TravelMate#TravelMate_Spin_B1) to host things. Lol
